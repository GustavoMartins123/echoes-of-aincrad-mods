# Modifications from the Original Nexus Releases

This document records the intentional differences between this integrated
Echoes of Aincrad mod suite and the exact original packages downloaded from
Nexus Mods.

It is named `MODIFICATIONS.md` rather than `CHANGELOG.md` because its primary
purpose is upstream provenance and patch disclosure, not a chronological
history of this suite's own releases. If the suite receives independently
versioned releases in the future, notable suite-level changes should also be
maintained in a separate `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Document status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Last verified | 2026-07-26 |
| Comparison scope | Six original Nexus packages versus the installed integrated files |
| Comparison method | Relative-path inventory, SHA-256 file comparison, and textual diff of changed source/configuration files |
| Intended audience | Players, reviewers, maintainers, and original mod authors |
| Upstream status | Local integration changes; no claim is made that they were submitted to or accepted by the original authors |

## Documentation method

This document follows three established practices:

1. Changes are written for humans and grouped under consistent categories such
   as **Added**, **Changed**, **Fixed**, **Unchanged**, and **Known
   limitations**, following the principles of [Keep a
   Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
2. Each component identifies its exact origin and baseline archive. This is
   adapted from the provenance fields recommended by the Debian [DEP-3 Patch
   Tagging Guidelines](https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep3/).
3. Original release numbers are not silently rewritten. If this integrated
   suite adopts its own version later, version changes should communicate API
   compatibility according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Only notable technical changes are included. Whitespace-only differences,
timestamps, logs, and transient UI state are excluded unless they change
runtime behavior.

## UE4SS 1.2.1

**Origin:** [UE4SS for Echoes of Aincrad on Nexus
Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/echoesofaincrad/mods/7)  
**Baseline:** `UE4SS_1012_EOA 7 1.2.1
2026-07-24T10-03Z V4y6UZcT5.zip`

### Changed

- Changed `DefaultExecuteInGameThreadMethod` in `UE4SS-settings.ini` from
  `EngineTick` to `ProcessEvent`.
- Enabled and made visible the interactive UE4SS GUI console by changing
  `GuiConsoleEnabled` and `GuiConsoleVisible` from `0` to `1`.
- Kept the plain external console disabled because the GUI console exposes the
  output and accepts commands.
- Added comments beside these settings explaining why they are intentional.

### Reason

The `ProcessEvent` execution method avoids making every mod dependent on one
shared EngineTick Lua callback. If that callback is removed after an error,
`ExecuteInGameThread` work can otherwise stop across the entire mod stack.

The GUI console is enabled to make live diagnostics and read-only mod commands
available without editing the loader again.

### Unchanged

SHA-256 comparison confirmed that these files are byte-for-byte identical to
the original Nexus archive:

- `dwmapi.dll`
- `ue4ss\UE4SS.dll`
- `ue4ss\UE4SS_Signatures\GNatives.lua`
- `ue4ss\UE4SS_Signatures\GUObjectArray.lua`
- `ue4ss\UE4SS_Signatures\GUObjectHashTables.lua`
- The bundled `BPML_GenericFunctions`, `BPModLoaderMod`, and `Keybinds` mods
- `mods.txt` and `mods.json`
- `Types.lua`, `UEHelpers.lua`, and `jsbProfi.lua`

The gameplay mods, ModMenu, and `ModMenuBridge.lua` were added around the
unchanged loader. They are not modifications to the UE4SS binaries.

`ModMenuBridge.lua` and `ModMenu/store.lua` include a fast-path settings revision system (`runtime.rev`), eliminating continuous I/O and Lua parsing on idle polling ticks by inspecting a lightweight revision token before reading full configuration tables.

## Terrain Runner SpeedMod

**Origin:** [Terrain Runner SpeedMod on Nexus
Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/echoesofaincrad/mods/45)  
**Baseline:** `SpeedMod v8 Stablized 45 8
2026-07-20T00-09Z 3CxMATjay.zip`  
**Original script version:** v7.11  
**Integrated script version:** v7.20

### Added

- Physical jump-height control through
  `CharacterMovement.JumpZVelocity`.
- `JUMP_HEIGHT_MULTIPLIER` in `Scripts\config.lua`.
- A validated jump-height range from 0.25× to 15.00×.
- Persistent hero and movement-component acquisition.
- Native jump-velocity capture and restoration when the mod is disabled.
- Stable movement-component identity through Unreal `GetFullName()`.
- Deduplicated waiting, ready, disabled, jump, and boost diagnostics.
- Live settings integration through the canonical shared
  `ModMenuBridge.lua`.
- `Scripts\runtime.lua` for settings written by ModMenu.
- Dynamic state-machine readiness based on consecutive hero and world stability sampling.

### Changed

- Replaced fixed startup and quarantine delays with a dynamic state-machine readiness check requiring consecutive stable hero/movement samples.
- Cached `MovementComponent` reference alongside `cachedHero` per world generation to eliminate per-tick component lookup.
- Fast-pathed movement baseline and jump height validation to bypass per-tick `GetFullName()` C++ reflection calls when component references remain unchanged.
- Replaced the legacy setting aliases with the exact public keys used by
  `config.lua`: `START_SPEED`, `MAX_SPEED`, `SECONDS_TO_MAX_SPEED`, and
  `JUMP_HEIGHT_MULTIPLIER`.
- Replaced silent defaults and numeric clamping with strict transactional
  validation. Missing, mistyped, non-finite, or out-of-range values now produce
  an explicit error and disable the mod.
- Raised the validated top-speed limit to 20.00×.
- Replaced the exposed `hero.CharacterMovement` field with the canonical
  `hero:GetMovementComponent()` call.
- Replaced first-live-sample jog learning with the exact
  hero-class-default `CharacterMovement.MaxWalkSpeed` baseline. Resuming while
  Sprint is already held can no longer teach the detector the sprint cap.
- Restricted player discovery to the canonical local host
  `RODWorldHeroCharacter`.
- Reduced hero/movement retry frequency to the loading interval while those
  objects are unavailable.
- Reset the current acceleration ramp after a live speed change so a multiplier
  from the previous configuration cannot remain active.
- Made the `speedmod` console command read-only. Persistent configuration now
  has one path through `config.lua` or ModMenu.

### Fixed

- Fixed movement staying paused for the rest of the session when a travel never
  reported completion. `ClientRestart` is registered by several mods at once, and
  UE4SS removes a callback when any of them throws — observed as
  `[Lua::Registry::get_function_ref] Ref was not function ... removing hook!`
  immediately before this component's 30-second travel timeout fired. The timeout
  only warned and left `mapLeaving` set, which the tick returns early on
  unconditionally, so movement never came back. It now hands over to the same
  readiness-stability path `ClientRestart` would have taken, resuming once the
  hero and movement component read valid or the quarantine clock passes. Which
  mod's callback was removed is not identified; this makes the outcome survivable
  rather than diagnosing it.
- Fixed a tick error that disabled part of the mod:
  `attempt to perform arithmetic on a function value (local 'x')` in
  `getHorizontalVelocity`. A component axis read through UE4SS does not always
  come back as a number — a stale component, or a name colliding with the
  wrapper's metatable, yields a function. A function is truthy, so the
  `velocity.X or 0.0` fallbacks never fired, and the arithmetic sat outside the
  `pcall` that was meant to contain it. The Lua error then took a UE4SS hook with
  it (`Ref was not function ... removing hook!`), so one bad read silently
  disabled part of the mod. Every axis in `getHorizontalVelocity`,
  `getHorizontalAcceleration` and `getActorLocation` is now type-checked for a
  finite number rather than only nil-checked; both call sites already handled the
  nil result.
- Fixed permanent-looking startup failure when the hero or movement component
  did not exist yet. The poll now remains active until both become valid.
- Fixed per-frame `JUMP READY` log flooding caused by UE4SS returning different
  Lua wrappers for the same Unreal movement component.
- Fixed stacked jump changes by retaining the native baseline for one real
  Unreal component and restoring it when disabled.
- Fixed partial configuration mutation by validating every field before
  committing any live change.
- Fixed mission transitions retaining a failed swept-offset state. The
  canonical swept movement call now pauses and retries after the new world is
  ready without changing to a secondary movement API.
- Fixed jump baselines being captured from an already modified instance after
  travel by reading the exact hero-class default movement component.
- Fixed checkpoint fast travel latching `mapLeaving` forever when the game
  repositions the existing world without emitting `ClientRestart`.
- Fixed horizontal boost failing to return after sleep while jump height
  remained active.

### Current integrated defaults

The current `runtime.lua` sets:

- Starting speed: 2.50×
- Top speed: 20.00×
- Time to top speed: 1.80 seconds
- Jump height: 15.00×
- Combat protection: inherited from `config.lua` and enabled

### Unchanged

The original terrain grading, swept collision, sprint detection, combat lock,
travel quarantine, teleport protection, and rest/quest transition systems were
retained.

### Known limitations

- Extreme speed and jump values can expose streaming, geometry, collision, or
  scripted-sequence behavior that the game was not designed to handle.
- A full game restart is safer than restarting every Lua mod in an active
  session.

## Auto Pickup Mod

**Origin:** [Auto Pickup Mod on Nexus
Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/echoesofaincrad/mods/19)  
**Baseline:** `AutoPickupMod 19 1.4
2026-07-23T15-17Z cLQPyYq9t.zip`  
**Original script version:** v1.3, despite the archive's 1.4 label  
**Integrated script version:** v1.4.1

### Added

- A separate documented `Scripts\config.lua`.
- ModMenu settings for enabled state, pickup range, icon range, pickup
  interval, notification display, icon-distance patching, prompt-area
  expansion, and debug logging.
- Live settings reload through `ModMenuBridge.lua`.
- `Scripts\runtime.lua` for menu-written settings.
- Persistent hero acquisition with one waiting and one ready transition per
  world lifecycle.

### Changed

- Moved user-facing values that were hard-coded in `main.lua` into the
  documented configuration file.
- Restricted hero discovery to the canonical local host
  `RODWorldHeroCharacter`.
- Made host validation fail closed when `IsHostHero()` cannot be confirmed.
- When pickup distance changes, clears expanded-item caches and previously
  applied range state before applying the new value.
- Made the `autopickup` console command read-only. Persistent configuration has
  one path through `config.lua` or ModMenu.
- Consolidated post-travel and post-rest scan workflows by removing redundant +3s and +8s delayed expand retries in favor of a single prompt scan upon world readiness.
- Cached valid `GameConfig` candidate instances in `collectGameConfigCandidates()` to avoid per-apply `StaticFindObject` and `FindFirstOf` reflection lookups.

### Fixed

- Fixed early startup behavior that appeared to stop when the playable hero had
  not spawned yet. The pickup poll now remains scheduled.
- Removed repeated post-travel `no hero yet` messages.
- Prevented stale range caches from delaying a live pickup-distance change.
- Removed force-resume travel watchdogs and alternate arrival paths.
  `ClientRestart` is now the sole mission-ready signal; if it is absent,
  pickup remains paused and reports an explicit transition error.
- Fixed checkpoint fast travel being treated as mission-world replacement.
  Same-world fast travel now clears range references, pauses for six seconds,
  and resumes through the normal persistent poll without requiring
  `ClientRestart`.

### Unchanged

The original pickup scanning, item operation, range expansion, notification,
travel protection, and cooldown behavior was otherwise retained.

### Known limitations

- The game's reliable pickup limit remains around 1000 Unreal units.
- Large ranges increase the number of nearby objects examined and can affect
  performance or stability.

## No Rescue — Real Falls

**Origin:** [No Rescue — Real Falls on Nexus
Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/echoesofaincrad/mods/35)  
**Baseline:** `Norescue 0.5.0 35 1
2026-07-13T13-48Z 3CxMATjJt.zip`  
**Original version:** 0.5.0

### Added

- Live settings integration through `ModMenuBridge.lua`.
- `Scripts\runtime.lua` for enabled state, landing behavior, debug logging, and
  the safety interval.
- Persistent hero acquisition through the existing safety timer.
- Stable hero identity through Unreal `GetFullName()`.
- Deduplicated waiting, ready, lookup, identity, and switch-error diagnostics.
- Native `DeathLandingHeight` capture before modification.
- A reversible live-disable operation.

### Changed

- Replaced optional typed overrides with a complete, strictly validated
  canonical configuration.
- Restricted hero discovery to the canonical local host
  `RODWorldHeroCharacter`.
- Made `ClientRestart` the canonical transition signal and reset the hero and
  game-configuration references without changing the persisted enabled state.

### Fixed

- Fixed the need to manually re-enable the mod when the hero was unavailable
  during the first application attempt; the safety timer now keeps retrying.
- Fixed live disable so it restores both the game's original landing threshold
  and edge-rescue behavior.
- Fixed repeated application caused by temporary wrapper identity by comparing
  the stable Unreal object name.
- Fixed lobby-to-mission travel requiring an OFF/ON toggle; the safety timer
  keeps reacquiring the new world until its exact hero and game configuration
  are available.
- Fixed the expected lobby interval without `RODGameConfig` being reported as
  an exception with a full traceback. The safety timer now reports one
  `WAITING FOR GAME CONFIG` transition and applies only after the canonical
  object exists; malformed objects and failed property access remain errors.

### Unchanged

- The original `README.txt` is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- Water, drowning, deep-water recovery, pit recovery, out-of-bounds recovery,
  and quest-area teleports remain outside the mod's scope.

## Aincrad Open World

**Origin:** [Aincrad Open World on Nexus
Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/echoesofaincrad/mods/55)  
**Baseline:** `AincradOpenWorld V1.0 55 1
2026-07-18T12-32Z V4y6UZc0K.zip`  
**Original version:** V1.0

### Added

- Runtime integration in `main.lua`.
- `ModMenuBridge.lua` support for `ENABLED`, `DEBUG_LOGS`, and `PROBE_MODE`.
- `Scripts\runtime.lua` for ModMenu-written settings.

### Changed

- Menu-world classification now uses the canonical `UWorld.GetFullName`
  contract and reports one explicit fault per distinct unavailable-world state.
- The existing `CONFIG` table is refreshed in place so closures registered by
  the original script observe new values.
- Made the exact script directory, configuration schema, floor-data files, and
  shared bridge mandatory. Invalid inputs now stop new quest mutation with an
  explicit error.
- Restored the canonical `enabled.txt` load marker so the script is registered
  before the lobby-to-mission transition.
- The ModMenu marks this component as affecting newly constructed manifests and
  requiring restart for a reliable clean application.

### Unchanged

Direct comparison confirmed that these original files are byte-for-byte
unchanged:

- `README.md`
- `Scripts\config.lua`
- `Scripts\probe.lua`
- `Scripts\wl01_pieces.lua`
- `Scripts\wl02_pieces.lua`
- `Scripts\wl01_barriers.lua`
- `Scripts\wl02_barriers.lua`

The original quest hooks, Free Roam labeling, manifest expansion, floor-piece
tables, barrier tables, and save-safe runtime design are unchanged.

### Known limitations

- If it was disabled before game launch, turning it ON only creates the
  next-launch marker; the game must then be fully restarted.
- A setting change cannot retract or rebuild a floor whose manifest is already
  active.

### Local state note

The original archive and this enabled installation both contain `enabled.txt`.
An earlier local `enabled.txt.off` marker prevented UE4SS from loading the mod
despite `runtime.lua` saying `ENABLED=true`; that inconsistent marker was
removed.

## Field Equipment Mod

**Origin:** [Field Equipment Mod on Nexus
Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/echoesofaincrad/mods/64)  
**Baseline:** `FieldEquipmentMod 64 1
2026-07-21T11-45Z 8WdQj6lM4.7z`  
**Original script version:** v1.14.3-release  
**Integrated script version:** v1.16.0

### Added

- A documented `Scripts\config.lua` with `ENABLED` and `DEBUG_LOGS`.
- Runtime settings reload through `ModMenuBridge.lua`.
- `Scripts\runtime.lua` for menu-controlled enabled state and logging.
- Shared-rail discovery for rows appended below Equipment.
- Explicit focus transfer between the native menu, Equipment, and Mods in both
  directions.
- Foreign injected-row detection.

### Changed

- Restricted local-controller lookup to the canonical
  `RODInGamePlayerController`.
- Added an enable guard when the Start Menu is constructed.
- Guarded native `CurrentIndex` writes so an injected row index is never written
  outside the authored native array.
- Clears selection animation from native and injected rows before transferring
  focus.
- Reasserts Equipment's label, texture, and selected presentation without
  moving focus a second time.
- Preserves the standalone wrap behavior when no other injected row exists.
- Replaced delayed construction-callback captures with a construction
  notification that resolves the exact component-owned Start Menu once on the
  game thread.
- Stores only the current Equipment context instead of retaining widget
  references from every historical menu.
- Removed continuous `FindAllOf(WBP_Console_MainMenu_C)` polling during
  gameplay.
- Removed the display-only `WBP_Console_MainMenu_C` clone that used to supply a
  stat panel beside Equipment, along with the `HeroDetail` nudge that positioned
  it. The stat panel no longer appears over the Equipment screen.
- The Equipment screen now shows the character, under the new `SHOW_CHARACTER`
  setting. Three things were needed and each was found by measuring what the
  previous attempt produced on screen:
  1. The character hide the Start Menu applies is undone through the game's
     keyed hide system: `ARODCharacterBase` carries `HiddenInGameKeys`
     (`TArray<FName>`) and `SetAllActorHiddenInGame(bHidden, Key)` adds or
     removes one key, with the actor staying hidden while any key remains. Every
     key present is removed on the way in and restored on the way out, and each
     one is named in the log. `OnMainMenuCharacterHidden(false)`, tried first,
     does not clear them — that attempt produced a correctly framed shot with
     nobody standing in it.
  2. The view target is handed back to the hero with the engine's
     `SetViewTargetWithBlend`, because `OnMainMenuOpened` receives the
     level-sequence `ACameraActor` the Start Menu frames itself with and the view
     can therefore belong to something else. Measured on this build it does not:
     by the time Equipment is up the view is already the hero, and the handover
     logs that it skipped.
  3. The framing itself comes from the widget's own `IsOpenCameraEnable` and
     `OpenForcedCameraSettings`, applied through `ProcessForcedCameraValues`.
     Every parameter in that struct is relative to the player's camera boom,
     which is why the view target has to be the hero before it runs.

  The previous view target is remembered and handed back on the way out, and
  both the hide keys and the view target are only restored to their menu values
  while a Start Menu is actually on screen, so no path can leave the player
  invisible or looking at scenery they cannot move.
  `ProcessForcedCameraValues` is the only place this mod hands a native struct
  back to a native function, so a step log is emitted immediately before it and
  `SHOW_CHARACTER` turns the whole feature off.
- Added a read-only `fieldequip` console command (`probe`, `open3d`).
- Returning from Equipment no longer detaches the real Start Menu and pushes it
  back into its widget component by hand. The mod now rearms in place when the
  menu survived, and otherwise reopens it through `DebugOpenMainMenu` so every
  rail mod receives its normal construction notification.
- The Equipment session is only treated as open once the widget is confirmed to
  exist, so the `EndMenu` the manager fires for the outgoing Start Menu is no
  longer mistaken for the player leaving.
- Added `CAMERA_HEIGHT`, a live setting that raises the camera boom's
  `TargetOffset.Z` while the Equipment screen is up. How high the shot should sit
  is a matter of taste, so it is a Mods-menu slider rather than a constant. The
  original offset is recorded and restored on the way out, and the nudge is
  written a second time after the forced camera finishes interpolating its own
  values.

### Measured on this build

- `ARODInGamePlayerController:DebugOpen3DMenu(ChestMenu, ChestEquipMenu)` is
  present in reflection and callable without error, and does nothing: no widget,
  no visible change, no log. It was tried as the Equipment entry point in
  v1.15.0 and reverted. `RODWidgetBPFunctionLibrary:DebugOpenMenu` + `OpenMenu`
  remains the only working path. `fieldequip open3d` re-runs the experiment if a
  future patch changes it.
- `ARODInGamePlayerController:OnMainMenuCharacterHidden(false)` does not clear
  the Start Menu's character hide. `ARODCharacterBase:SetAllActorHiddenInGame`
  against each key in `HiddenInGameKeys` does.

### Known limitations

- Some Equipment labels can render as `<MISSING STRING TABLE ENTRY>` —
  "Proficiência na Arma", "MOD Único", "MOD Extra", "Armas Obtidas" and similar.
  Item names, descriptions and every other panel resolve normally. The string
  table those particular keys live in is not resident: opening this screen in the
  field skips whatever pulls it in at a chest, and string tables are collectable,
  so whether it is present varies within a session rather than between builds.
  `fieldequip strings` lists what is loaded, which is what naming the asset to
  preload will need.

### Fixed

- Fixed the Mods row, and any other mod's rail row, being lost after visiting
  Equipment. The clone's rail carried only this mod's row, and the by-hand
  restoration produced a Start Menu that no other mod was ever notified about.
- Fixed navigation disappearing when moving upward from Mods to Equipment.
- Fixed focus skipping directly to Settings or requiring an extra directional
  input after returning to Equipment.
- Fixed two menu icons appearing selected simultaneously.
- Fixed Field Equipment stealing focus back from another injected rail row.
- Fixed custom injected indexes being written into the native list's
  `CurrentIndex`.
- Fixed Equipment disappearing when a checkpoint rebuilt the Start Menu.

### Unchanged

The rail injection technique, the navigation bridge around the injected row, and
the equipment workflow itself were retained. The stat-overlay lifecycle and the
by-hand menu restoration it required were removed rather than retained; see
Changed above.

## New integrated ModMenu layer

**Origin:** Added for this integrated suite  
**Original archive:** None of the six Nexus baselines contains ModMenu or
`ModMenuBridge.lua`

**Current script version:** v1.5.15

### Added

- A **Mods** row below the native Start Menu entries.
- A calibrated `M` row icon.
- A settings panel rendered inside the existing menu.
- Keyboard and controller navigation.
- Modal input isolation so the outer Start Menu does not react while the Mods
  panel is open.
- Bidirectional, identity-based focus routing across the live rail without a
  named dependency on another mod.
- A per-mod registry with setting types, ranges, application timing, and
  display formats.
- Persistent values in each mod's `Scripts\runtime.lua`.
- Transactional enable/disable behavior that updates live `ENABLED` state and
  the next-launch `enabled.txt` marker together.
- Rollback to the previous runtime and marker state if either filesystem
  operation fails.
- Transaction-locked `runtime.lua` publication so independent mod readers
  never observe a valid but partially written settings table.
- The shared `ue4ss\Mods\shared\ModMenuBridge.lua` used by isolated Lua states.

### Changed

- Field Equipment is marked `+` because its row is rebuilt when the Start Menu
  is reopened.
- Open World is marked `*` because its effect depends on newly constructed
  quest manifests and may require a restart.
- UE4SS's built-in `mods.txt` and `mods.json` remain unchanged; gameplay Lua
  mods continue to use only their `enabled.txt` markers.
- Uses construction notification plus exact live-menu identity, with its later
  400 ms slot preserving deterministic row order.
- Retains only primitive menu identity while waiting to inject and only the
  current live context afterward.
- Removed continuous global widget scans while the Start Menu does not exist.

### Fixed

- Fixed the display-only Start Menu guard in `injectModsEntry` being gated on an
  `inViewport` variable that was never assigned in that function, so the guard
  was permanently disabled. Rejection happened one layer up in
  `isCanonicalMainMenuCandidate`, which is why it went unnoticed.
- Fixed controller Left/Right handling inside the Mods panel.
- Fixed Back/B closing behavior for the panel.
- Fixed the outer Start Menu receiving the panel's navigation input.
- Fixed Equipment-to-Mods and Mods-to-Equipment focus asymmetry.
- Fixed mod-header toggles changing the wrong mod's enable marker.
- Fixed custom rows writing invalid native list indexes.
- Fixed SAO Battle Equipment, Field Equipment and other injected rows pushing
  Mods outside controller/keyboard navigation. The bridge now follows the live
  visual rail by UObject identity, excludes a hidden authored row directly, and
  owns directional hand-offs without requiring cooperation from another mod.
- Uses the injected icon's native `GetIsMouseHover()` state for LMB and hovered
  Enter. One LMB over that exact UObject opens Mods directly; the native list's
  `CurrentIndex` can no longer turn every click back into a first selection. No
  screen-geometry approximation or parallel click-delegate path remains.
- Added exact Slate mouse targets to the settings panel. Transparent UMG buttons
  cover each visible label and both halves of each value, while the rendered text
  is hit-test-invisible; LMB can now expand, select, decrement, increment, toggle,
  and close without any world-to-screen geometry approximation.
- Removed modal writes to every authored and injected rail row. `Item_0` proved
  that the authored Blueprint interaction gate does not retain the requested
  disabled state, so treating it as a writable contract prevented every panel
  open. ModMenu now consumes native keyboard/controller input in its guarded
  hooks and owns a transparent full-`SubMenu` Slate shield for mouse isolation.
  Opening and closing the panel never reads or changes another row's input,
  visibility or focus state.
- Keeps native ProcessEvent navigation inside the authored range and adds a
  boundary-only keyboard route based on exact UObject focus identity. Up from
  the first physical row resolves directly to the last injected row, while a
  duplicate native callback converges on the same destination instead of moving
  twice.
- Sizes the settings panel from the live `SubMenu` canvas. The close target,
  values and wrapped footer remain inside the clipped world-space menu area.
- Suppressed focus events generated by the router's own UObject focus calls and
  added direct recovery when a hidden authored `Item_*` receives focus.
- Decoded hook parameters synchronously and retained guarded callbacks so a Lua
  routing error consumes that press, reports its traceback, and cannot make
  UE4SS remove the navigation hook for the rest of the session.
- Made the decorative `M` text hit-test-invisible. It remains rendered above the
  icon without intercepting the native row's mouse hover and click events.
- Suspends rail reordering, ItemIndex recalculation and wrap detection while a
  native submenu has collapsed part of the authored rail, so a `5 -> 5` focus
  event from Settings cannot be mistaken for a wrap into Mods.
- Fixed lobby-to-mission transitions requiring manual OFF/ON cycles. Each
  loaded mod now retains its persisted setting while map-owned references are
  invalidated and reacquired.
- Fixed live numeric edits exposing a partially written `runtime.lua`, which
  could make SpeedMod reject a temporarily missing `START_SPEED`.
- Fixed the Mods row disappearing after checkpoint reconstruction.
- Fixed World Enemy Director retaining outgoing-mission enemy references until
  `ClientRestart`; quest-end events now release references before world
  collection and leave asynchronous actor teardown to Unreal.
- Fixed standalone `ClientRestart` events discarding World Enemy Director
  ownership inside the same mission. Existing extras are now retained instead
  of being rediscovered as natural enemies and multiplied recursively.
- Added a dedicated quarantine for `ServerNotifyQuestTeleportOut` and a
  two-second stable-discovery barrier before the first extra spawn.
- Boss detection now uses the reflected `EnemyRole_Boss` enum together with
  `GoldenGateBoss`. Bosses can be mutated explicitly but can never be
  multiplied or selected by species randomisation.
- Blueprint classes reused by a mission boss are quarantined for that world.
  A late classification after an owned actor was issued now pauses the director
  with an explicit mission-restart error instead of destroying an actor while
  Unreal may still be initializing it asynchronously.
- Fixed a configuration read failure being replaced by registry defaults in the
  panel. Missing, malformed, or invalid canonical settings now fail closed and
  are reported explicitly.

## New World Enemy Director component

**Origin:** New local implementation based on public reflected game contracts

**Original archive:** None of the six Nexus baselines contains this component

**Current script version:** v1.7.3

### Added

- Extra-enemy multiplication, loaded-species randomisation, boss quarantine,
  colour presets, visual scale, Gameplay Ability System combat multipliers,
  movement speed, experience multipliers, world-transition quarantine, and
  exact owned-actor accounting.
- A ModMenu registry entry and strict transactional configuration.

### Changed

- Replaced raw deferred `GameplayStatics` actor construction with the game's
  reflected `RODGameState.RODSpawnActor` population contract.
- Replaced the unsupported reflected `FVector&` output from
  `K2_GetRandomReachablePointInRadius` with complete
  `UNavigationPath` validation through
  `FindPathToLocationSynchronously`.
- Tests up to 12 golden-angle candidates over multiple director cycles,
  retaining the request while the NavMesh is building or candidates remain.
  Only one synchronous path query is allowed per cycle.
- Uses valid, non-partial `UNavigationPath` state as the reachability contract;
  the unreliable zero path-length value exposed by this UE4SS build is not
  treated as a second contract.
- Resolves the natural source enemy by exact object identity for native owner
  and instigator.
- Calls the exact `RODSpawnActor` parameter sequence declared by the supplied
  game header. Runtime UFunction-property enumeration was removed because this
  UE4SS build does not expose `ForEachProperty` on its Lua UFunction wrapper.
- Reports the rejected native property and remaining Lua argument types in one
  compact spawn-contract fault instead of discarding that diagnostic context
  or emitting the full repeated stack dump.
- Invokes `RODSpawnActor` through
  `RODGameState:CallFunction(UFunction, ...)` in the declared C++ parameter
  order. Direct UFunction `__call` invocation on UE4SS build `c838a8ac` left
  its callable table in the marshaling stack and shifted `inOwner` and
  `InInstigator`.
- Acquires the UFunction from the current `RODGameState`, providing
  `CallFunction` with a bound calling context. The bound UFunction reference is
  cleared on every world transition.
- Requires 50-150 cm separation from natural, pending, and owned enemies and
  uses `AdjustIfPossibleButDontSpawnIfColliding`.
- Supplies `FRODSpawnActorOption` with server spawn, source level, `Prowl`
  initial state, initial state location, active perception, and Behavior Tree
  startup.
- Reads ownership only from
  `FRODSpawnActorResult.ServerSpawnActor`.
- Applies random visual size to skeletal-mesh `RelativeScale3D` instead of the
  character actor root, preserving capsule, NavMesh-agent, perception,
  controller, and movement geometry.
- Classifies `ServerDecideFastTravel` as a same-world quarantine. Existing
  ownership is retained and processing resumes after eight seconds instead of
  waiting forever for a `ClientRestart` that checkpoint travel does not emit.

### Fixed

- Fixed a burst of `required GAS attribute is absent: MaxHealth` errors after
  fast travel. An enemy streaming in during a world transition is visible before
  its ability system has published its attribute set, and a whole cell's worth
  arrives at once, so what was a rare race became routine once fast travel
  worked. The discovery queue already retried two snapshot failures — missing
  skeletal mesh and unreadable fields — but matched them by exact string, so the
  GAS cases fell through to being reported as broken enemies. Retry now covers
  every "not ready yet" snapshot failure by prefix, and the budget is 12 attempts
  spaced 250 ms apart by a wall-clock gate rather than 5 attempts that were spent
  within a few frames. An enemy that is still incomplete after three seconds is
  reported with that fact stated.
- Fixed enemy multiplication producing nothing. Commit `2cd07a9` rewrote the
  spawn path and changed two things at once; both had to be undone:
  1. `UGameplayStatics::BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass` +
     `FinishSpawningActor` was replaced with `ARODGameState:RODSpawnActor`, which
     cannot be called from Lua on this build. Every argument was verified correct
     and in the declared order, the `FTransform` was rebuilt natively, and
     `InInstigator` was tried as both an actor and null; the rejection never
     moved off `[push_objectproperty] ... :InInstigator`. The
     `FRODSpawnActorOption` table is the only thing left between the two calls,
     and no readable property in the game holds a real one to borrow.
     `ARODInGamePlayerController:ServerDebugEnemySpawn`, tried as a third option,
     returns without error and creates nothing despite having a real native
     symbol.
  2. `SPAWN_Z_OFFSET_CM` was deleted, so the spawn point sat exactly on the
     ground. A character capsule created flush with the surface fails its
     collision check and no actor appears — this alone would have been enough to
     make multiplication silently stop.

  The deferred pair is restored, and it also returns the actor it created, so
  ownership is exact again and `takePendingSpawn` claims by object identity
  rather than by proximity.
- Fixed spawned enemies standing inert. A deferred spawn produces the pawn and
  nothing else, so the enemy arrives as a model without logic.

  Possession is not the gap — that was measured and ruled out. These Blueprints
  carry `AutoPossessAI = 3` (`PlacedInWorldOrSpawned`), the engine attaches an
  `AIC_*` controller by itself, and `SpawnDefaultController` was a no-op with the
  same controller present before and after. Having a controller is not the same
  as having started.

  What the game's own path does and `GameplayStatics` does not is the rest of
  `FRODSpawnActorOption`: `IsStartBehaviorTree` and the initial state. On
  `ARODEnemyCharacter` those are `StartAI(DetectFlag)` and `StartBehaviorTree()`,
  now called once the enemy reports itself initialized rather than immediately
  after creation — an enemy whose assets are still resolving has nothing for a
  behaviour tree to run. `DetectFlag` mirrors the option struct's `IsNodetect`,
  which this mod sets false. The first activation of a session logs
  `SPAWN ACTIVATION` with the controller and both call results.
- Fixed `ARODEnemyCharacter:StartAI`'s argument being passed inverted, which is
  what made every extra blind. It was called as `StartAI(true)`, read as
  "DetectFlag = yes, detect". Clearing `DisableDetectFlag` before the call and
  reading it back after showed the write not surviving — false going in, true
  coming out, with nothing between but that call — so the parameter is the option
  struct's `IsNodetect`, not its opposite. It is now `StartAI(false)`, and
  `DisableDetectFlag` is cleared last, after everything known to write it.
- Supplied the last two pieces of `FRODSpawnActorOption` that the
  `GameplayStatics` path never provides. `InitialStateLoc` corresponds to
  `ProwlFirstPosition`, the anchor the idle/patrol logic works around; on an
  actor created outside the game's own spawn call it stays at the origin, so a
  spawned enemy's whole notion of where it belongs was `(0,0,0)` on the far side
  of the map. It is now seeded with the spawn position, along with
  `ProwlGoalPosition` and a cleared `ProwlGoalPositionFlag`. `DisableDetectFlag`
  is the matching half for perception and nothing was clearing it, so the enemy
  had no reason to look for anyone — the reported "I am invisible to them". The
  activation log now reports both plus `DetectStartFlagN`.

  This is also the leading candidate for the repeating worker-thread crash:
  `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` reading `0x8` appeared twice with a **byte-for-byte
  identical** call stack (`+1592357 → +15920f8 → +1592a8c → +140a342 → …`), on
  Foreground Worker #1 and later Background Worker #13. A reproducible single
  work item, not noise, and prowl/navigation maths against an origin anchor fits
  it. Unproven — the frames still cannot be symbolicated.
- Narrowed boss protection to the mission's own boss. `EnemyRole_Boss` is worn
  by field elites too — `BP_E001004`, a big boar, carries it — so treating that
  role as "boss" pulled ordinary elites out of the spawn catalog entirely and
  left them unmutated. Protection now keys on staging that only a real boss owns:
  `GoldenGateBoss`, or a non-null `BossEventSequence` /
  `BossFinisherLevelSequence`. The role is still recorded in the snapshot for
  diagnostics but no longer decides anything by itself, and the log line is now
  `MISSION BOSS PROTECTED`.

  This also widens what `INCLUDE_BOSSES` gates: elites are ordinary enemies now,
  so they are mutated and may be multiplied like any other species. Only the
  mission boss is excluded from both.
- Fixed spawned enemies never perceiving the player — invisible until hit, and
  slow to react even then. Two `StartAI` functions exist and they are not the
  same thing: `ARODEnemyCharacter:StartAI(DetectFlag)`, which was already being
  called, is enough to get an enemy idling and patrolling, while perception lives
  on the controller side. `ARODAIControllerBase:StartAI(ProcessedPawn)` binds the
  possessed pawn into the perception system and `ApplyBindFunction` wires its
  delegates; the engine auto-possesses the pawn but nothing calls those, because
  the game's own path reaches them through `RODSpawnActor`. The controller is now
  set up first, then the character, then the behaviour tree.
- Replaced fixed settlement timers (`STARTUP_SETTLE_MS`, `RESTART_SETTLE_MS`, `QUEST_TELEPORT_SETTLE_MS`) with a dynamic state-machine readiness check requiring 3 consecutive stable hero and controller samples.
- Cached `FGameplayAttribute` handles by class key in `snapshotGas()`, eliminating per-enemy `GetAllAttributes()` native array reflection.
- Fixed stutter introduced with distance recycling. `FindFirstOf` walks the
  global object array and was being called twice per tick to locate the hero; it
  is now resolved once and kept until it stops being valid. The nearby-origin
  reconcile is `O(origins x states)` and ran every tick alongside it; it now runs
  when recycling actually frees a slot, or on a 3-second cadence.
- Added `DESPAWN_RADIUS` distance recycling. Origins on this map are actors
  placed in the persistent level, so they never become invalid and
  `cleanupInvalidStates` never fires for them: extras created in the first area
  visited stayed alive forever, held the whole `MAX_ACTIVE_EXTRAS` budget, and no
  new area ever received any. Owned extras beyond the radius from the hero are
  now released, and each freed slot is handed back to its origin so returning
  refills it. Origins within the radius are reconciled every tick, because a
  persistent-level enemy is only discovered once per world and would otherwise
  never re-issue.
- Actors are no longer created while World Partition is streaming, gated on
  `UWorldPartitionSubsystem::IsAllStreamingCompleted`. A deferred request is put
  back at the head of the queue untouched, so it does not consume the navigation
  budget. The gate fails open and says so once if the subsystem cannot be
  resolved.

  A third crash then arrived from the same family as the `NavigationPath` leak,
  but on a spawned enemy's AI controller:
  `Fatal world leaks detected ... (PendingKill) (async) AIC_E001001_C -> Outer =
  PersistentLevel -> Outer = World`, on mission end. The controller had been
  destroyed and still could not be collected. No callable `IsAsyncLoading`
  predicate is exposed to Lua, so the creation moment cannot be gated precisely;
  `IsAllStreamingCompleted` is World Partition cell state, which is related but
  not the same condition. Distance recycling is the practical countermeasure —
  it bounds how many owned actors are alive when the fatal check runs — but the
  leak is **not solved**, and a long session in one place can still reach it.

  This is a **mitigation, not a diagnosed fix**. Two crashes were seen under
  heavy spawning — `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` reading `0x8` on Foreground
  Worker #1 at 169 s, and reading `0xa4` on Background Worker #3 at 671 s — in
  two different work items sharing the same task-graph worker tail. Neither could
  be symbolicated: `Data/mappings/native-symbols` covers only `exec*` UFunction
  thunks and the frames land megabytes from the nearest one, and the crash
  report's readable callstack carries no offsets. Creating actors mid-stream is
  the one thing this mod does that fits both, and objects created on the game
  thread during async loading are known to be born with
  `EInternalObjectFlags::Async`.
- Fixed `RANDOMIZE_EXTRA_SPECIES` permanently consuming a spawn slot on an
  unlucky draw. One random pick landing on an entry that had become ineligible
  was treated as "nothing can be spawned here": the slot was marked issued and
  the failure was reported as an empty catalog. The draw now starts at a random
  position and walks the catalog once before giving up, and the two distinct
  failures — no spawnable species at all versus an origin species that is not
  spawnable — are reported as themselves.
- Added a give-up guard: after `UNMATCHED_SPAWN_GIVE_UP` consecutive created
  actors that never complete initialization, the director logs one
  `SPAWN DISABLED` line and stops queueing instead of repeating the same failure
  every poll cycle. One successful claim clears it. `enemy_director_status`
  reports the state, and mutation of existing enemies is never affected.

### Fixed (unrelated, found while investigating)

- The spawn object contract called `IsA` with class-path strings
  (`owner:IsA("/Script/Engine.Actor")`). That overload is not dependable on this
  build, so the gate meant to catch a wrong object before native marshaling was
  answering from an unreliable comparison. It now resolves `Actor` and `Pawn`
  with `StaticFindObject` and passes the UClass objects.

### Failure behavior

Missing navigation, population, result, weak-pointer, mesh, or lifecycle
contracts stop that operation with an explicit error. There is no raw-spawn or
actor-root-scale compatibility path.

A population-call contract failure rolls back the director, clears queued
work, and emits one concise world fault. It is not retried every poll cycle.

## New Fast Travel component

**Origin:** New local quality-of-life implementation

**Original archive:** None of the six Nexus baselines contains this component

**Current script version:** v0.14.0

### Added

- A native-styled "Fast Travel" row in the Start Menu, injected with the game's
  own `WBP_Console_MainMenu_MenuIcon_C` wrapper so the rail keeps its focus
  order and other mods' injected rows stay reachable.
- The game's own `WBP_Map_FastTravel_C` destination picker as the target screen,
  opened as a Start Menu submenu with `UWidgetBlueprintLibrary::Create` followed
  by `URODWidgetBPFunctionLibrary`'s `DebugOpenMenu` + `OpenMenu`, with
  `ParentMenu` and `MenuKind` stamped on the widget beforehand.
- A read-back of `URODWidgetData::MenuWidgetMap` before opening, logging which
  widget class the menu system maps that kind to on this build.
- Teleporting from the destination the screen itself decided. The mod reads the
  ID out of `ARODPlayerState::ServerDecideFastTravel`, matches it against
  `ARODGameState::RODAccessibleGimmicks` by `ARODAccessibleGimmickBase::ID`, and
  takes the arrival point from that actor's `WarpOutTransforms`, falling back to
  `AccessTransforms[0]` and then to the actor's own location. The chosen source
  and coordinates are logged as `MOD TELEPORT`.
- A guard that leaves real terminal fast travel alone: the takeover runs only
  while the mod's own screen is open and only when `FastTravelStatus` is not
  `Enable` and `bAccessingTerminal` is false.
- Hooks on the fast travel screen's own input path
  (`OnDetailMapTermialIconClickDelegate`, `OnInputClickEvent`,
  `EndOpenAnimEvent`). These observe and consume nothing. Unlike the mod's
  functional hooks they are registered softly: losing one costs a diagnostic,
  not the feature.
- A `MAP_TARGET` setting in `config.lua` selecting `"fasttravel"` (default) or
  `"map"`, keeping the reference-map path available for diagnosis.
- Observation of `ARODAvatarCharacter::ActivateFPCameraMenuAbility`, recording
  the event tag, menu key and target for every first-person-camera menu the game
  opens. A `fasttravel menukeys` console report prints what has been observed
  alongside `GA_AvatarMenu_Map_C`'s own `LevelSequenceMap` keys.
- A `MAP_MENU_KEY` setting in `config.lua` overriding the resolved menu key. It
  is deliberately absent from the ModMenu registry, which has no text field.

### Changed

- The Fast Travel row opens `WBP_Map_FastTravel_C`, the game's own fast travel
  screen, where confirming a checkpoint is measured working end to end. It
  declares its own scope in its banner — "Escolha para qual Área Segura ou
  Terminal de Teletransporte você vai" — so map pins are drawn on it but cannot
  be confirmed; `fasttravel pin <index>` serves those. `MAP_TARGET = "map"` opens
  the reference map instead, whose cursor stops on every icon and is therefore
  the only screen where a pin could be confirmed, at the cost of an unproven
  confirm interception on a screen that is not the fast travel UI.
- The reference-map path is now opened through
  `ARODAvatarCharacter::ActivateFPCameraMenuAbility(EventTag, MenuKey, Target)`
  instead of
  `URODAbilitySystemComponent::TryActivateAbilityWithPayloadFromClass` with a
  blank `FGameplayEventData`.
- `GA_AvatarMenu_Map_C`'s `CurrentEventData` is no longer read as a precondition.
  Nothing consumed it once the payload stopped being the activation vehicle.
- Open verification scans for both map widgets rather than one, so a run that
  lands on the wrong screen reports `MAP SCREEN MISMATCH` instead of reporting
  that nothing opened.
- The Start Menu is no longer closed before the fast travel screen opens. The
  screen is a submenu of it, which is what makes Back return there.
  `EndMainMenu(true)` and the wait on `GA_AvatarMenu_Main_C` now belong only to
  the `MAP_TARGET = "map"` path.

### Fixed

- Fixed the Fast Travel row opening the wrong screen. `WBP_Map_C`
  (`URODMapMenuWidgetBase`) is the reference map headed "Mapa / Detalhes da Área
  de Missão"; it draws pins and markers but exposes no terminal-selection
  delegate. The destination picker is `WBP_Map_FastTravel_C`
  (`URODFastTravelMenuWidget`), which carries
  `OnDetailMapTermialIconClickDelegate` and is what a terminal opens. Natively
  that screen comes from `GA_AvatarMenu_AccessTerminal_C`, whose `Target` is a
  real terminal actor; constructing the widget directly reaches the same screen,
  so no terminal is impersonated.
- Fixed the teleport not moving anything. Two ROD debug teleports were tried in
  the running game and neither moves the hero:
  `ARODAvatarCharacter::ServerDebugTeleportGimmick(FVector)`, this component's
  originally documented teleport, and
  `ARODInGamePlayerController::ServerDebugTeleport(FVector)` — the latter
  measured as `ServerDebugTeleport called=true` followed half a second later by
  the hero still 23703 cm from the target. `ARODGameState` holds both a
  `DebugTeleportPos` field and its own `ServerDebugTeleportGimmick`, so those
  calls appear to park a position for a later gimmick warp rather than perform
  one. Movement now uses `AActor::K2_TeleportTo`, which lands the hero on the
  target (read back at 0 cm). Both dead ends are recorded in the source so they
  are not tried again. Arrival is still verified from the world, since a teleport
  into unstreamed World Partition cells remains possible.
- Fixed pin travel dropping the hero through the world. `FRODMapPin::Pos` is
  stored with `Z = 0` — a map pin is placed on a 2D map — so the measured
  `(27196.8, 289435.9, 0.0)` sat roughly 25000 units below the ground it marks.
  Pin positions are now projected onto the navmesh with
  `UNavigationSystemV1::K2_ProjectPointToNavigation` and a deliberately tall
  query extent, and a pin that does not project is refused rather than travelled
  to. This affected `fasttravel pin <index>` as shipped in v0.7.0.
- Fixed the hovered icon being read from the wrong widget, twice. It is not
  `URODMenuWidgetBase::CurrentFocusWidget`, which on a map screen is the map
  rather than an icon, and it is not the base
  `URODMapItemWidgetBase::CurrentTargetIconWidget` either — the cursor probe read
  that one as empty while hovering a pin. The fast travel screen builds a
  `WBP_FieldMap_C`, a `URODFieldMapItemWidget`, which keeps its own
  `CurrentStayTerminalIconWidget`. All candidates are now tried, and only a pin
  kind is accepted from any of them so a tracked terminal cannot shadow the pin
  the cursor is over.
- Fixed a viewport change, such as Alt+Enter, trapping the player on the map
  screen. The screen survives unfocused: its cursor keeps tracking the mouse,
  Confirmar stays greyed, Cancelar does nothing, and nothing in the game closes
  it — the Start Menu cannot be reached from there, so no in-game recovery
  exists. The escape hatch is therefore a UE4SS keybind (`FORCE_CLOSE_KEY`,
  default F8), processed outside the game's input, which force-dismisses the
  screen, hands input back through
  `URODWidgetBPFunctionLibrary::SetCurrentMenuInputActionEnable` and resets the
  component's state. `fasttravel close` does the same from the console.
  Separately, `teleportMapModeActive` had been blocking every later open for the
  rest of the session; it is now validated against the screen it refers to and
  cleared when stale.
- Fixed the Fast Travel row appearing in town, where it can only fail. The row is
  no longer injected when the current world holds no accessible gimmick carrying
  an ID, which is the real question and hardcodes no map name. It is re-evaluated
  on every Start Menu construction, so moving between town and a floor needs no
  transition tracking, and the count is reported as `FAST TRAVEL AVAILABILITY`.
- Fixed the town map producing three failed lookups per confirm. There the screen
  decides `ID=None`, because that world's `RODAccessibleGimmicks` holds two
  gimmicks of its own rather than the floor's terminals. It is now refused once,
  by name, instead of being treated as a missing terminal.
- Fixed the pin census never running.
  `ARODInGamePlayerController::UniqueIdMapIconMap` cannot be read from Lua: UE4SS
  returns a `TrivialObject` with no `ForEach` for a `TMap<uint32, ...>`, unlike
  the `TMap<EMenuKind, ...>` the menu-widget lookup walks successfully. The icons
  are enumerated by widget class (`WBP_MapIcon_C`) instead.
- Fixed confirming a destination hanging the screen. The native flow announces
  the choice with `ServerDecideFastTravel(ID)` and then waits for the server to
  move the hero; away from a terminal `FastTravelStatus` is `Disable`, the server
  does nothing, and the screen stays up with a live cursor. Measured as three
  `ServerDecideFastTravel` calls roughly 200 ms apart for one confirm, no travel,
  and a stuck screen. The mod now performs the travel from the announced ID and
  dismisses the screen. The three repeats are collapsed by a gate set
  synchronously in the hook, so only the first queues work.
- Fixed the fast travel screen never being constructed.
  `ARODPlayerState::OpenMenu(EMenuKind)` is not the local UI entry point: with
  the kind confirmed correct in the same run — `MENU WIDGET MAP | EMenuKind 66 ->
  WBP_Map_FastTravel_C` — the call returned and the verification found "0
  presented of 0 constructed". The open now uses the `Create` +
  `DebugOpenMenu` + `OpenMenu` sequence already measured to work for the
  Equipment screen.

- Fixed the map never appearing. `GA_AvatarMenu_Map_C` derives from
  `GA_AvatarMenu_FirstPersonCamera_C`, which resolves its opening level sequence
  through `LevelSequenceMap`, a `TMap<FName, ULevelSequence*>` indexed by
  `CurrentMenuKey`. That sequence is what eventually reaches
  `ARODInGamePlayerController::DisplayMapMenu`, and `DisplayMapMenu` is what
  constructs `WBP_Map_C`. Activating with a blank payload left the ability with
  no menu key, so it activated and then did nothing. The measured symptom was
  exactly that pair of log lines: "map gameplay ability activated" followed 2.5
  seconds later by "WBP_Map_C was not constructed", with neither
  `OpenDirectingMapMenu` nor `DisplayMapMenu` ever entered.

### Known limitations

- **A crash was caused by this component's own diagnostics and has been removed.**
  The `CURSOR_PROBE_KEY` binding ran roughly forty native UI calls per press —
  twelve icons × geometry, kind, hover and visibility reads, plus a `MapPins`
  walk — with no debounce, so holding the key re-entered that work faster than it
  completed. The crash stack showed UE4SS hook frames interleaved with the same
  three engine addresses repeatedly and jumped to an invalid code address, and
  the log ends mid-probe. The probe, the `WBP_Map_C` icon helper, the
  `SnapMapIconKinds` mutation and the geometry-based cursor matching are all gone
  — roughly 560 lines. None of them had ever been shown to do anything, and two
  of them wrote into widget state the game owns.
- Pin travel is bound to a key (`PIN_TRAVEL_KEY`, default F9) because the screen
  offers no trigger for it. "Confirmar" is greyed out over a pin — that screen
  accepts only safe areas and teleport terminals — so `ServerDecideFastTravel`
  never fires there and there is no confirm to intercept. Detecting the pin
  correctly changes nothing while the trigger itself cannot happen, which is what
  every confirm-based attempt before this was missing.
- Fixed `<MISSING STRING TABLE ENTRY>` returning on the fast travel screen. The
  labels track whether a `WBP_Map_C` has been constructed in the session:
  correct while v0.13.0's icon helper existed, which built one on every open, and
  missing again once it was removed — the log shows them resolving after a
  `WBP_Map_C` construction at 20:16:48 and missing at 20:22 with none.
  Constructing the reference map evidently pulls in the string assets the fast
  travel screen's keys resolve against. A companion `WBP_Map_C` is now built once
  and kept, and nothing else is done with it; the parts that made the old helper
  dangerous — redirecting its `MapItemWidget` at another screen and calling
  `GetIconForMap`/`UpdateIcon` through it — are not restored.
- The pin under the cursor is decided from `UWidget::RenderTransform`, which is
  where these positions actually live. Canvas slot position and
  `GetCachedGeometry` both read `0,0` for every widget including the cursor —
  wrong place to look, since an icon that moves across a map is positioned by
  render translation, not by its slot. `RenderTransform` is a plain property, so
  this is a field read with no UFunction call behind it. The screen's own
  selection box still does not move onto pins: that lives in its Blueprint and is
  not reachable, so only the decision is reproduced, not the highlight.
- **Every route into the screen's own selection has been eliminated in the
  running game, not assumed:**
  - `SnapMapIconKinds` already contained the pin kinds before anything was
    appended.
  - `SetInputEnable(true)` wrote cleanly (`false -> true` on every pin) and
    changed nothing.
  - `ESlateVisibility` moved `SelfHitTestInvisible` → `Visible` and changed
    nothing; no ancestor was `HitTestInvisible`.
  - `GetIsMouseHover()` stays `false` on every icon even once they are visible
    and input-enabled.
  - `URODIconForMapWidgetBase::GetCanHoverIcon` — the one function named for the
    job — **is never called by the game.** A hook installed cleanly on the native
    path (`native hook (206, 207)`) and unconditional instrumentation of its
    first three invocations never fired once, and there is no Blueprint override
    to intercept instead: `WBP_MapIcon_C:GetCanHoverIcon` does not exist as a
    UFunction. That hook has been removed rather than left in place.
- Pin icons are made hit-testable when the screen opens. `SetInputEnable(true)` alone was measured insufficient —
  it wrote cleanly (`IsInputEnable false -> true | write=true` on all five pins)
  and hover still never fired. Input permission is not hit testing: map icons are
  drawn so they do not intercept the mouse over the map, and a widget outside hit
  testing cannot report hover whatever its input flags say. Each pin icon is now
  raised to `ESlateVisibility::Visible` and enabled, and any ancestor found at
  `HitTestInvisible` is moved to `SelfHitTestInvisible`, which re-admits the
  children without letting the ancestor start swallowing clicks itself. Reported
  per pin and per ancestor as `PIN HOVER`.
- Pin hover is read from `URODInputWidgetBase`, which is where the game keeps it.
  That class is the base of every interactive widget and
  `URODIconForMapWidgetBase` inherits it through `URODMenuItemWidgetBase`; it
  exposes `GetIsMouseHover()`, `SetInputEnable(bool)` and `IsInputEnable()`, all
  confirmed exported. The hovered pin is therefore asked of the icon rather than
  computed from coordinates, and the icons are given `SetInputEnable(true)` when
  the screen opens, since a widget with input disabled never receives hover at
  all. Every earlier attempt tried to compute the answer — canvas slots, cached
  geometry, absolute positions, nearest-wins — and all of it read `0,0`, because
  that is not where this information is kept.
- With exactly one pin placed, travel does not require hover; there is nothing to
  disambiguate. With several, the hovered one is used.
- Earlier notes on pin selection, kept because the measurements stand:
  `MapPins[1] EMapPinKind=7 timestamp=68.9378 pos=(27196.8, 289435.9, 0.0)` and
  `PinIcon[8] kind=27 timestamp=68.9378 visible=true canHover=false`. The
  timestamp join works and the kind mapping (7 → 27) is confirmed, but every
  widget including the cursor reads `0,0` through both the canvas slot and the
  cached geometry, and the icon reports `canHover=false` — the screen will not
  let the cursor rest on a pin. With one pin placed the choice is unambiguous;
  with more than one the mod lists them and defers to `fasttravel pin <index>`,
  since nothing on that screen can point at one.
- Two claims made earlier about pins were disproved by the screen itself:
  - "The fast travel screen never creates a pin icon." It does. Its map item
    reported `PinIconWidgets` at 12 before any injection ran, for a world holding
    one map pin — a pre-allocated pool, whose spare slots read back with
    `Timestamp` 0.
  - "The nearest pin icon is under the cursor." The probe reported `0 px away`
    for an icon that was nowhere near it. Every widget was reading the same
    position through `GetCachedGeometry` + `LocalToAbsolute`, so the
    nearest-wins comparison always returned the first pooled slot. Position is
    now read from the canvas slot, which is what the map writes when it places an
    icon, with the geometry route only as a fallback.
  - "`SnapMapIconKinds` is what excludes pins." It is not. That screen's array
    already contained `32` (`InstantPin1`) and `27`–`31` (`PillarPin1`–`5`)
    before anything was appended, so pins were already snappable and the cursor
    still would not stop on one.
  - "The `WBP_Map_C` icon helper draws the pins onto this screen." It reported
    one pin drawn and left `PinIconWidgets` at 12 — no observable effect.
  All four of those code paths have been removed. `fasttravel pin <index>`
  travels to any pin and never depended on them.
- The reference-map selection pipeline (`resolveSelectedMapIcon`, the `UpdateIcon`
  destination cache, the `MapDecidedEvent` / `MapClickEvent` interception) is
  original to this component and has never run end to end, because until v0.7.0
  the map could not be opened and the teleport moved nothing. Both are fixed, and
  it is now the default path, but its confirm interception is not yet confirmed
  by a run.
- `<MISSING STRING TABLE ENTRY>` labels appeared on the fast travel screen in
  earlier sessions and no longer reproduce; the screen now renders its headline
  and legend correctly. Nothing in this component is known to have fixed it, so
  it is recorded as unexplained rather than resolved. The theory that
  `UWidgetBlueprintLibrary::Create` leaves `UIManagerRef` and
  `PlayerControllerRef` null was tested and is **wrong**: UE4SS refuses to write
  either (`[push_weakobjectproperty] Operation::Set is not supported`) and the
  read-back showed both already correctly populated. FieldEquipmentMod's
  Equipment screen still shows the labels.
- The old `WBP_Map_C` selection pipeline — `resolveSelectedMapIcon`, the
  `UpdateIcon` destination cache, and the `MapDecidedEvent` / `MapClickEvent`
  interception — reads `URODMapMenuWidgetBase` members that
  `URODFastTravelMenuWidget` does not share. It stays inert against the fast
  travel screen by construction and is kept for `MAP_TARGET = "map"`.
- The menu key sent to `ActivateFPCameraMenuAbility` is resolved rather than
  configured: the ability's own `LevelSequenceMap` keys first, then keys observed
  from the game's own menu activations, then `MAP_MENU_KEY`. This affects only
  `MAP_TARGET = "map"`.
- Fast Travel works from a floor map only. In town the row is hidden rather than
  offered and refused. Showing a floor's map from inside town would mean travel
  between worlds, which is a different operation than moving the hero within one
  and is not attempted.
- The move is a position change, not the native fast travel transaction. No
  `FastTravelStatus` is written and no terminal is impersonated, so the arrival
  cutscene, fade and partner warp the native path would play do not happen.

## New Experience Notifications component

**Origin:** New local quality-of-life implementation

**Original archive:** None of the six Nexus baselines contains this component

**Current script version:** v1.2.0

### Added

- A live ModMenu toggle for native EXP notifications.
- Exact observation of the single
  `ApplyAcquisition(Source, AcquisitionData)` reward transaction, filtered to
  enemy sources and using `AcquisitionData.ExperiencePoint` directly.
- An `EXP +N` entry built with the game's `URODEventMessageWidget`, inserted in
  the active `URODInfoMessageLogWidget.Information` stack.
- Native timer ownership through `SetMessageTimer`, avoiding Lua references to
  enemy, player, widget, or world objects across travel.
- Immediate read-back validation of the written native rich text, with
  transactional widget removal when the game rejects or replaces `EXP +N`.

The game's `DT_InfoMessageDataTable` contains no EXP row; `1014` and `1015` are
explicitly stealing/collection messages. The component therefore does not
misuse a localization row or substitute an unrelated message key. If the
acquisition or active message-stack contract is unavailable, it reports an
explicit error and does not create another overlay.

## Generated and local-state files

The following files are not upstream source modifications:

| File | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Scripts\runtime.lua` | Current overrides written by ModMenu |
| `enabled.txt` | UE4SS loads the mod on the next launch |
| `enabled.txt.off` | Local disabled-state marker |
| `ue4ss\UE4SS.log` | Runtime diagnostics |
| `ue4ss\imgui.ini` | UE4SS GUI window state |

The original Auto Pickup and Field Equipment archives store `1` in their
`enabled.txt` files. ModMenu writes the canonical `enabled` marker text. UE4SS
uses the marker's presence, so its contents do not change enablement semantics.

## Maintenance rules for future changes

When this integrated suite changes again:

1. Record the new comparison date in ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
2. Preserve the exact upstream archive filename and Nexus origin.
3. Compare full relative-path inventories before comparing individual files.
4. Verify unchanged files by hash and changed text files by semantic diff.
5. Document the reason and user-visible effect, not only the implementation.
6. Use only the categories that contain notable changes; omit empty headings.
7. Keep generated files and local enablement state separate from source
   modifications.
8. State what remained unchanged so reviewers can see the patch boundary.
9. Keep known limitations beside the component they affect.
10. Do not change an original release's contents while retaining its upstream
    version number. Give the integrated suite its own version when it begins
    publishing independent releases.
11. Maintain a separate chronological `CHANGELOG.md` once this suite has its own
    releases.
12. Recheck each Nexus page's current permissions before distributing modified
    files.
